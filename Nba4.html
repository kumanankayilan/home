		<h2> The Dynasty to end all dynasties. </h2> 
		<p> in 1956 with the 2nd overall pick in the NBA draft the St. Louis Hawks selected Bill Russell. They traded him to the Boston Celtics in return for Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley, both Hall of Fame players. </p> 
		<p> This Trade ended up working for the Celtics and Bill Russell helped the Celtics become the greatest dynasty in the history of sports. </p> 
		<p> At the time the trade was thought to be absolutely insane. Why would you trade a great NBA player and an upcoming star? Not many people but Red Auerbach and a few more thought the trade would work out. </p> 
		<p> It almost instantly did. The next year in 1957 the Boston Celtics one their first NBA title with the help of Bill Russell and upcoming point guard Bob Cousy. </p> 
		<p> Over the next few year, the Celtics would absolutely dominate with what would be considered to be the very first superteam in NBA history. 
		<p> The team had the likes of Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek all being legit threats on the court. Nobody could stop them. Infact they won an NBA record 8 straight championships. <p> 
		<p> The Celtics won a total of 11 championships in the 13 year span that Bill Russell was drafted and retired and this all happened because of a gamble. </p>

		<h2> The Triple Digit game </h2> 
		<p> Wilt Chamberlain was a freak of nature. A man so gifted that stories about his strength or speed were often told as if they were greek myths. </p> 
		<p> One of Wilt's myth like acts happened in March of 1962. </p> 
		<p> Wilt had already been on a tear to start his career. The season before he had averaged an absolutely unthinkable 50 points per game and 48.5 minutes per game. There were 48 minutes in a game. </p> 
		<p> Wilt had juts been in his 4th season and yet he had already been setting insane records that still haven't been broken today. </p> 
		<p> March 2nd 1962 was no different. It was a simple game against the middling New York Knicks. The game wasn't televised so it wasn't that important. </p> 
		<p> Wilt Chamberlain though made it special. He kept scoring and scoring even when he knew the game was out of reach. He quickly beat the scoring records set in place and was soon near 80 points. </p> 
		<p> Wilt kept scoring on the inside until he hit the illustrious triple digit score. The final score of the game was 169 - 147 and the Warriors won. Right after the game Wilt sat down and held his now iconic 100 point sign. </p> 
		<img src = "http://www.espn.com/media/nba/1999/1012/photo/a_wc.jpg" alt = "Wilt Chamberlain holding the 100 point sign" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />

		<h2> Havlicek stole the ball </h2> 
		<p> John Havlicek was already a great player that was bound to be in the Hall of Fame at some point. </p> 
		<p> This play, though would go on to seal his name in the history books. </p> 
		<p> Game 7 NBA Eastern Conference Finals 1965. The Celtics had already won quite a lot of championships and were always dominant in their wins. </p> 
		<p> So imagine how much of a shock it was that the 7 game series against the Philadelphia 76ers went this far. </p> 
		<p> Even with that shock, the Celtics had a single point lead with only a few seconds left in regulation. Hal Greer, an NBA hall of famer for the Philadelphi 76ers had one job. 
		he had to inbound the ball to try and get a shot off to win the game for the 76ers. Just as he was to inbound, Havlicek though had other plans. </p> 
		<p> Just as Greer inbounded, Havlicek jumped and grabbed the ball passed it down. This play alone saved the Celtics title hopes and the legendary commentation has been cemented in NBA history </p>

		<h2> Kareem Abdul Jabbar and the 70s </h2> 
		<p> Many of the greats from the 50s and 60s had retired or were at the twilight of their careers when the 70s rolled around. </p> 
		<p> Because of this the NBA needed new talent, fast. So it was perfect timing that Lew Alcindor arrived on the scene </p> 
		<p> Before Kareem was Kareem, his name was Lew Alcindor. Lew was a player that could be described as a combination of Wilt and Bill. </p> 
		<p> Kareem had the great defensive qualities as Bill, the great scoring that Wilt had and the great rebounding that they both had. </p> 
		<p> Because of this Kareem was dominant throughout most of the 70s. He won a startling 6 MVPS through this time while he help his Milwaukee Bucks consistently be great </p> 
		<p> Kareem holds the record for most Mvps won. He won them in 1971, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980 as a Buck and then Laker.

		<h2> The Longest Win streak in NBA history </h2> 
		<p> The Lakers didn't win many championships since the first few years of the NBA. <p> 
		<p> They often were stopped in their tracks by many of the other great teams of the time like the Celtics and 76ers. </p> 
		<p> In the 70s though, the old greats of the 60s teamed up for one last dominant go at a title. </p> 
		<p> Wilt Chamberlain had only won a single NBA championship prior to joining the lakers. Wilt was almost always stopped by the Celtics and their legendary title run so his chances to even get to the finals were already pretty low. </p> 
		<p> Most people saw Wilt as a great standalone player but not a great team player. Jerry West was also seen as this. He tried and tried again for ages to try and get past the Celtics but could never amount to it. He even did so good in one of the finals, he was 
		awarded finals MVP even though his team lost. </p> 
		<p> Even when Jerry West and Wilt teamed up they couldn't bring a title to LA. That all finally changed in the 1971 - 1972 season. </p> 
		<p> With future Hall Of Famer Gail Goodrich, this Lakers big 3 couldn't lose. The 3 were equally balanced and amounted to 33 wins straight. An NBA record. </p> 
		<p> The Lakers won 60+ games overall and then defeated the Knicks in 5 to give Jerry his 1st title and Wilt his 2nd. Wilt was awarded Finals MVP. </p>

		
		<h2> Showtime </h2> 
		<p> The 80s were a time where the NBA needed to become popular again. </p> 
		<p> Scandals, diminishing ratings and an overall lack of interest was on the rise. </p> 
		<p> One could say, that it was showtime for the Lakers of the 80s. </p> 
		<p> The 1970s in the NBA was a dark place. The main stars of the 60s had retired and the NBA was a no mans land. Some players like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and George Gervin 
		took advantage of this and helped the NBA as much as they could with their star power. </p> 
		<p> Some other stars though like Spencer Haywood were found in cocaine and other drug scandals. The ABA also took a lot of players from the NBA and threatened to put it out of buisness. </p> 
		<p> Thats when Magic Johnson came to play. Having being drafted in 1979, Magic was a young superstar in the making. He instantly carried the Lakers to one of the best teams in the league 
		and even won a title in his first year. His legendary rivalry with fellow young star Larry bird helped revitalize the NBA and bring it out of its dark ages. The Showtime lakers were given that name
		becuase of their flashy and fast playstyle, something that had never been seen until then. </p> 
		<p> The Showtime lakers won a total of 5 championships over the course of the 80s and officialy helped make the NBA popular again. </p>

		<h2> Larry Lefty </h2> 
		<p> Larry Bird was an insane player and even more insane of a trash talker. </p> 
		<p> Sometimes he didn't talk trash with his words, instead he did it with his game. </p> 
		<p> One instance of how he trash talked with his game was on valentines day 1986. This season was Larry's year. His Celtics at the time were 39 - 9 and he was feeling pretty bored of how dominating 
		the Celtics were. </p> 
		<p> Because of this in a game against Portland, Larry decided to disrespect the full Portland team that day by playing with his non dominant hand. Larry ended up with 47 points and helped the celtics win their 40th game of the season. </p> 
		<p> The Celtics would also eventually win the championship that season and were hailed as one of the greatest teams of all time </p>

		<h2> Jordan v Wilkins </h2> 
		<p> Hotshots Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were already on the rise before this dunk contest. </p> 
		<p> This dunk contest though would be one of the many things that sent them into 90s superstardom. </p> 
		<p> This dunk contest showcased two of the greatest dunkers of all time: Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins. </p> 
		<p> February, 6th, 1988. Reigning dunk contest champion Michael Jordan went up against his best opponent yet: Dominique Wilkins. </p> 
		<p> Both were already on the rise to be some of the best NBA players of the 90s but now their budding rivlary was focused on winning the dunk contest. </p> 
		<p> The contest went back and forth with many iconic dunks between the both of them. Both were neck and neck in the final round when Jordan got a perfect 50 on his dunk from the 
		free throw line and Dominique got a surprisingly low score with his dunk. </p> 
		<img src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mny1kAxF2zQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt = "A picture of Michael Jordan dunking the ball from the free throw line" height "400" width "400" class = "center" />
		
		<h2> Larry Legend in a warm up jacket </h2> 
		<p> Larry Bird returns. This time its even more savage of a trash talking story </p> 
		<p> Along with being a great trash talker, Larry was also a great three point shooter. </p> 
		<p> During the three point contest the NBA was holding during all star weekend in 1988, Larry was so confident that he'd win that very contest, 
		that he'd went into the locker room where everyone was beforehand and asked "Who's playing for 2nd?" </p> 
		<p> Larry backed up the talk by winning that three point contest. He even celebrated before the last shot went in. He also did this all in a warmup jacket. The ultimate 
		sign of disrespect </p>
		
		<h2> The Shot. </h2> 
		<p> Chicago Bulls vs Cleveland Cavaliers, 1989. </p> 
		<p> Michael Jordan had an oppurtunity to show the world how good he really was. </p> 
		<p> It was game 5 of a 5 game series between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Chicago Bulls. </p> 
		<p> The teams had went back and forth for most of the match and now it was 99 - 100 in favour of the cavs with only a few seconds to go. </p> 
		<p> This next play would be important for the Bulls because it would show that last season's run was not a fluke. In their way was a fantastic Cavaliers team with All star point guard 
		Mark Price at the helm. </p> 
		<p> This cavs team was a real problem. </p> 
		<p> The Bulls had the ball and immediately inbounded it to Jordan. </p> 
		<p> Jordan got the ball, dribbled it for a second then took the shot with a second left over Craig Ehlo. </p> 
		<p> The buzzer immediately rang after the shot went off and sunk, ending the Cavs hopes of making it out of the 1st round. Jordan immediately jumped up and started swinging his arms in celebration of the legendary moment. </p>

		<h2> Shrug game </h2> 
		<p> Michael Jordan was arguably an even more petty of a player than Larry Bird was. </p> 
		<p> This game showed exactly why. </p> 
		<p> Clyde Drexler of the Portland TrailBlazers was probably Jordan's biggest competitor for the greatest in the world title. </p> 
		<p> Jordan did not like that. Infact, it was Jordan's mission to destroy Drexler during their finals matchup in 1992. </p> 
		<p> Jordan did just that in game 1. </p> 
		<p> Jordan dropped 39 points in the game and 6 threes. After the 6th three was made, Jordan just looked over to the commentators table and Magic Johnson and just shrugged. </p> 
		<p> No words were said but the simple action was petty enough. </p> 
		<p> Jordan and the Bulls won their 2nd championship a few weeks later. </p>

		<h2> He's back. </h2> 
		<p> Could Michael Jordan three peat for the second time? </p> 
		<p> Michael Jordan sadly retired from the game of basketball after his father passed away in 1993. </p> 
		<p> He instead took up a career in baseball which was his dads favourite sport. </p> 
		<p> After that didn't work out Jordan was lost. He eventually decided to return to the NBA late into the 1994 - 1995 season. </p> 
		<p> All he said "I'm Back" </p> 
		<img src = "https://i.insider.com/5509ed856bb3f793669c145d?width=1000&format=jpeg&auto=webp" alt = "A fax showing Michael Jordan's statement" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
		
		<h2> The final shot </h2>
		<p> Michael Jordan and the Bulls were ending soon. Everyone knew it. </p> 
		<p> Jordan couldn't go out with a whimper instead he when with a bang. </p> 
		<p> Michael Jordan had come back and won 2 more championships as apart of the Bulls. </p> 
		<p> He was about to do it again in game 6 of the NBA finals vs the Utah Jazz. </p> 
		<p> This time though, it was different. Phil Jackson was soon to be gone, Pippen was unhappy and Jordan was getting old. </p> 
		<p> The team wasn't going to be together for long and many knew it. </p> 
		<p> So what did Jordan do? He made a shot over Bryce Russell to win the game and the NBA finals for the 6th and last time. </p>

		<h2> Its over </h2> 
		<p> Vince Carter brought dunk contests back into the NBA spotlight with his iconic performance in all star weekend. </p> 
		<p> Vince was the new guy on the block and signalled in a new era for the NBA. </p> 
		<p> Him and the relatively new Toronto Raptors were making some noise in the NBA as a fun high flying team with Carter at the helm. </p> 
		<p> He put himself and cousin Tracy Mcgrady on the map even more with his dunk contest performance. </p> 
		<p> The dunk contest prior to this one had been boring to say the least. Infact many over the last decade had been pretty middling or boring. </p> 
		<p> No real tricks were introduced and their was no real star power their either. Carter immediately changed that with his first perfect 50 of the night. </p> 
		<p> He did a 360 and extended his arm out for a massive slam to shocked everyone spectating. </p> 
		<p> it was the first dunk in about 10 years that really was great. Vince carter continued to put on a show dunking with a 360 from BEHIND the backboard and even dunking with his whole arm in the basket. </p> 
		<p> Vince won the dunk contest and made it known by saying to the camera repeatedly "Its over" Kenny smiths iconic call made this a moment to remember. </p> 
		<img src = "https://trashtalk.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/495a0b2a50f15dc7e4a547cebd03cb32-e1569048781531.png" alt = "Vince Carter right in the middle of saying that its over" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
		
		<h2> Iverson over Lue </h2> 
		<p> Game 1 NBA finals 2001. 76ers vs Lakers. </p> 
		<p> Allen Iverson had already carried the horrible sixers team to this finals and they were here to face the Los Angeles Lakers who had won every single game so far. </p> 
		<p> Iverson had put on a show in Game 1 of the finals. Iverson would end up putting up 48 and the 3 he was about to take would help solidify the only win that the sixers would ever get of the Lakers during the series </p> 
		<p> Iverson crossed over Tyronn Lue and sunk in the three. Lue then tripped on Iverson's show and as a show of disrespect, Iverson stepped over Lue while he was on the ground. </p> 
		<p> This showed to the Lakers that the sixers were not a team like the others they'd face before. </p> 
		<p> Even though the sixers lost Iverson forever stained what would've been the Lakers perfect run. </p> 
		<img src = "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/NgAiC4cQ39f3zD0bBwazIgfqwyY=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5ZTKW6ABIFBFHAR5SZDKURYINU.jpg" alt = "Allen Iverson stepping over Tyronn Lue" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
		
		
		<h2> Ray Allen saves the day </h2> 
		<p> Game 6 NBA finals 2013. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs. </p> 
		<p> The Heat are down 3 with only a few seconds left in regulation. </p> 
        <p> This was the 3rd finals that the new Miami Heat big 3 had been too since their inception just a year prior. </p> 
		<p> in the 2010 - 2011 season they lost in 6 games to the Dallas Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki. </p> 
		<p> The season prior they played their hearts out and returned to the finals and won in 5 games against the Oklahoma City Thunder </p> 
		<p> This season the Miami Heat returned to the finals but faced a much tougher opponent in the San Antonio Spurs </p> 
		<p> The spurs were a much more balanced team as a whole and gave the Heat a run for their money. Infact they were about to win the title. The championship trophy and hats were out but the Heat were still trying 
		to make a desperate attempt at winning the game and extending it to a game 7. </p> 
		<p> The final desperate attempt was when Lebron took a three to try and tie the game. He missed pretty bad. Chris Bosh grabbed the rebound and passed to Ray Allen in the corner. </p> 
		<p> Ray took it with a hand in his face and sunk it tying the game which caused the Heat to win the 6th game and the finals eventually. </p>

		<h2> Rip KOBE </h2> 
		<p> The Mamba said goodbye to the NBA and went out in the only way he could. </p> 
		<p> Everyone knew for quite a while that Kobe was retiring at the end of the 2015 - 2016 season. </p> 
		<p> The whole league had given him a proper send off. It made it even better that his final game was where he spent 20 years playing basketball in . </p> 
		<p> Kobe was ready to play his final game for the Lakers and the NBA. He did quite a lot too. He dropped 60 points against the Utah Jazz and sent the crowd into pure shock and happiness </p> 
		<p> His final points that he ever scored was on the free throw line, the same place where he first scored his first points. </p> 
		<img src = "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/15/sports/15lakers02/15lakers02-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg" alt = "Kobe after winning the game for the Lakers" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
