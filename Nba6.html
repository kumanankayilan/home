	<h2 id = "Shoes"> Shoes. </h2> 
	<p> Clothing and shoes are a major thing in the NBA. Stars always go to games decked out in their best clothing possible and then play in their signature shoes that millions have bought. </p> 
	<p> Companies like Nike, Jordan, Adidas and Under Armour have made massive profit off of selling both shoes and clothing  centered around players for years now. </p> 
	<h3> Nike </h3> 
	<p> Named as the most valuable apparel brand in the world in 2021, Nike and their signature slogan "Just Do it" have been a staple of sports culture for ages now. </p> 
	<p> They are the official sponsor of the NBA jerseys and most NBA players were their shoes. </p> 
	<p> Some notable players that have signature shoes from them are: Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan and Giannis Antentokounmpo. </p> 
	<p> Each of these players and many more have brought billions of profit towards the Nike brand especially when it comes to shoes. </p> 
	<p> Some popular shoes are: LeBron 20s, the Kd 15 and the Zoom freak 1 </p>

	<h3> Under Armour </h3> 
	<p> This brand is suprisingly on the rise as it wasn't that popular until only a few years ago. </p>

	<h2 id = "Videogames"> Videogames </h2> 
	<p> Like most sports there is always a longstanding videogame franchise that fans can play on their given console. </p> 
	<p> The most popular NBA game is the 2k series. </p> 
	<p> The 2k series has been going on for more than 20 years now and has evolved greatly over that time. </p> 
	<p> The games have went from simple basketball simulation games with the rosters of its time to games with a career mode, an online trading card game, a simulation game with classic, new and combined teams and a park where many players can interact. </p> 
	<p> Even though the series has gone under much scruntiny as of recent, the series has still been able to bring in tons of money every year. </p> 
	<p> Some cover athletes include: Allen Iverson, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Luka Doncic </p>

	<h2 id = "The play in > The Play - in </h2> 
	<p> The play in game is a weird thing. The concept was first introduced in 2020 and first carried out in 2021. </p> 
	<p> What happens is that basically the 7th - 10th seed teams get to battle it out in single game elimination to get the final 2 playoff spots. </p> 
	<p> the top two and bottom 2 teams face off first. The winner of the top two matchup automatically gets a playoff spot and the loser faces the winner of the bottom two matchup. </p> 
	<p> The loser of the bottom two matchup is out and the play in finals commence. The winner of that game gets the final playoff spot. </p> 
	<p> So far there have been only 2 play in tournaments. One was in the 2020 - 2021 season and the other last season. </p> 
	
	<h2 id = "The ABA"> The ABA </h2> 
	<p> The ABA or the American Basketball Association was a short lived but fierce rival to the NBA. </p> 
	<p> The league was made in 1967 and ended in 1976. </p> 
	<p> The league had the likes of Julius erving, Artis Gilmore and George Gervin to name a few. The league also had many teams that you might recognise today like the New York Nets ( now Brooklyn Nets )
	, the Denver Nuggets and the Indiana Pacers. </p>
