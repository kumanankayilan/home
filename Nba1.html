	<h1> Part 1: About the NBA </h1> 
	<p> The Nba has a lot of basics that need to be went over before the major parts are dived into. </p> 
	<h2>Here is everything that will be talked about in part 1: </h2> 
	<ol>

	<h2 id = "Basic rules, basic violations and basic fouls"> Basic rules, basic violations and basic fouls </h2>
	<p> As with any sports league, there are quite a lot of rules, violations and fouls that both casual and hardcore fans will know and argue about. Here are a few. </p>
	<h3> 5 basic rules </h3> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Only 5 players on the court per team at all times. More than 5 will result in a technical foul. </li> 
	<li> Any team only has 5 seconds to inbound the ball. If they fail to do so, this will result in a turnover. </li> 
	<li> Each team only has 8 seconds per play to bring the ball past the halfcourt line. A turnover will happen if they fail to do so. </li> 
	<li> Each team has a total of 6 timeouts. </li> 
	<li> Each team has 24 seconds per play to shoot the ball. If the ball hits the net/backboard and the same team regains possesion, the shot clock resets to 11 seconds. </li> 
	</ol> 
	
	
	<h3> 3 basic violations </h3> 
	<ol> 
	<li> If a player holds the ball with two hands then dribbles again this is called as a double dribble. </li> 
	<li> If a player takes more than two steps without dribbling the ball, this is called as a travelling violation.<li> 
	<li> If the ball goes past the court and onto the differently coloured part of the court ( usually black ) it is called as a out of bounds violation. </li> 
	</ol> 
	
	<h3> 3 basic fouls </h3> 
	<ol> 
	<li> If a player commits illegal contact towards another player when they are in the act of shooting this is called as a shooting foul. Free throws are awarded based on if the player was behind or in front of the three point line and if they made the shot or not. </li> 
	<li> If a player commits illegal contact towards another player when they have the ball but are not in the act of shooting, this is called as a reach in foul. After a certain point these also become free throws. </li> 
	<li> If a player displays unsportsmanlike conduct towards the referee or to another player ( getting into a fight, excessive complaining and taunting ) this is called as a technical foul. 2 technicals result in an ejection. The other team shoots a free throw and regains possesion of ball. </li> 
	
	<h2 id = "The Positions"> The positions </h2> 
	<p> There are a total of 5 positions in an NBA game. </p> 
	<p> Each of these positions have there own set of skills that a player must live up to. </p> 
	<p> These positions are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> The point guard </li> 
	<li> The shooting guard </li> 
	<li> The small forward </li> 
	<li> The power forward </li> 
	<li> The center </li> 
	</ol> 
	<h3> The point guard </h3> 
	<p> The point guard is arguably the most important position out of the 5. </p> 
	<p> The point guard is responsible for getting the offense going, throwing the most passes and being the vocal leader of the team normally. </p> 
	<p> With a good point guard a team may go from barely missing the playoffs to becoming title contenders. </p> 
	<p> Most times the point guard is the shortest or among the shortest on the team standing at about 5'10 to 6'3. </p> 
	<p> Some notable point guards are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Stephen Curry </li>

	</ol> 
	<h3> The Shooting guard </h3> 
	<p> The shooting guard is usually the best scorer or shooter on the team. </p> 
	<p> These are the players that are often hanging around the three point line on offense. </p> 
	<p> They are also the players that might drop 40 on any given night. </p> 
	<p> While this position isn't as vital as a point guard, it is still incredibly important. </p> 
	<p> Some notable shooting guards are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> James Harden </li>

	</ol> 
	<h3> The small forward </h3> 
	<p> The small forward is usually the most balanced player out of the 5. </p> 
	<p> While the first two positions are usually played by average or good defensive players and great to exceptional offensive players. </p> 
	<p> The small forward position is often played by players that can be really great on both sides. </p> 
	<p> These players are known to guard the bigger positions and are also known to have a great deal of strength and muscle. </p> 
	<p> Some notable small forwards are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Lebron James </li> 
	<img src = "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1MjUwMjYxNzgwOTMyMjQz/lebron-james.jpg" alt = height = "300" width = "300" class = "center"/>

	</ol> 
	<h3> The power forward </h3> 
	<p> The power forward is much alike to the aformentioned small forward and soon to be mentioned center. </p> 
	<p> While this position's players aren't always the greatest offensive threat, they are very effective at defending and collecting rebounds. </p> 
	<p> Infact, most power forwards responsiblity is the play defense first and offense later. This doesn't mean that they are bad at offense though. </p> 
	<p> Some notable power forwards are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Giannis Antentokounmpo </li> 
	<img src = "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-05/giannis-antetokounmpo-fttr.jpeg?itok=XtE5AQVV" alt = "A picture of Giannis Antentokounmpo" height = "300" width "300" class = "center"/>

	</ol> 
	<h3> The center </h3> 
	<p> The centers are almost always the biggest and most strongest player on the court. </p> 
	<p> Most times, defense is their main and only focus. There are of course outliers though. </p> 
	<p> The center is likely the second most important player on the team behind the point guard. <p> 
	<p> Some notable centers are: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Nikola Jokic </li>
