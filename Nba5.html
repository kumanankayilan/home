	<p> Many NBA teams disbanded before the league was even the age of a toddler and many disbanded much later into its lifespan </p> 
	<h2> Baltimore Bullets </h2>
	<p> The Baltimore Bullets were a team that was around a few different times. </p> 
	<p> Their first stint was when the Nba was first founded until 1954. </p> 
	<p> The team wasn't that succesfull in their stint but was notable as the team that would eventually lead to the Washington Wizards </p>

	<h2> Buffalo Braves </h2> 
	<p> The Buffalo Braves were the Clippers before the Clippers existed. </p> 
	<p> This team was not good most of the time. Even though they had great talent in Bob McAdoo they never really amounted to nothing and eventually were moved to San Diego and then Los Angeles. </p>

	<h2> Chicago Stags </h2>
	<p> Chicago Stags were one of the first NBA teams to disband but were the team that eventually lead to the Chicago Bulls </p> 
	<p> The Stags were not around for long but when they were here they made one of the first ever finals appearance in the leages history. </p>

	<h2> Cinncinati Royals </h2> 
	<p> The Cinncinati and then Rochestor Royals were the kings before the kings were bad. The royals were a pretty middling to good team for their duration and even won a championship in 1956. </p> 
	<p> The teams best player was the legendary Oscar Robertson a textbook player when it came to being balanced. </p>

	<h2> Fort Wayne Pistons </h2>
	<p> The Fort Wayne Pistons were the Detroit Pistons of old. They weren't the best but made a few finals apperances but never won one </p> 
	<img src = "https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/244/full/4953.gif" alt = "Fort Wayne Pistons logo" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> Minneapolis Lakers </h2> 
	<p> The Lakers were the first team that had a truly dominant player. George Mikan was the first true NBA superstar. </p> 
	<p> The Lakers were the first team to win multiple NBA championships but quickly relocated to Los Angeles only a few years later </p> 
	<img src = "http://sportslogohistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/minneapolis_lakers_1948-1960.png" alt = "Minneapolis Lakers logo" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> Philadelphia Warriors </h2> 
	<p> The Philadelphia Warriors only true claim to fame was being the team that had Wilt Chamberlain for most of his career. </p> 
	<p> Wilt Chamberlain was the player that single handedly carried the warriors for most of the 60s and some of the 50s but couldn't do much in the playoffs. </p> 
	<p> They did win one championship though, and they were the only team to win a title in the 60s that wasn't the Celtics. </p>

	<h2> Providence Steamrollers </h2> 
	<p> This team disbanded fairly quickly in the NBA's lifespan and only had really one interesting thing come from it. </p> 
	<p> This team is the worst team in NBA history and won a total of 6 games. </p> 
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Providence_Steamrollers_logo.svg/1200px-Providence_Steamrollers_logo.svg.png" alt = "A picture of the steamrollers logo" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> Toronto Huskies </h2> 
	<p> Since basketball was invented by a canadian, it was only natural that when the first major basketball league was made, that there would be a canadian team. </p> 
	<p> The first ever NBA game was between the New York Knicks and the Toronto Huskies. </p> 
	<p> Sadly, the Huskies lost that game and most of the season and disbanded right after the season ended. </p>

	<h2> Charlotte Bobcats </h2> 
	<p> The most recent team on this list, the Charlotte nba teams have had a pretty weird timeline of events. </p> 
	<p> It all started in the late 80s ( 1988 to be specific ) when the Hornets were first founded. 
	<p> The team didn't really do much for its first 14 years of existence and eventually moved to New Orleans. </p> 
	<p> Charlotte was given a new team: The Bobcats. </p> 
	<p> The Bobcats were the laughing stock of the NBA, winning barely any in its 10 year lifespan and even winning 7 games on season. </p> 
	<p> After the 2013 - 2014 season the Bobcats became the Hornets again and the New Orleans team became the Pelicans. </p>

	<h2 id = "What was happening before the NBA"> What was happening before the NBA </h2> 
	<p> There were not many leagues that were centered around Basketball before the NBA came along. </p> 
	<p> Infact there were only really two main leagues. These leagues were the NBL ( National Basketball League ) and the BAA ( Basketball Association of America ) </p> 
	<p> The NBL was established in 1898 and was the premier basketball league until 1946 when the BAA was made. </p> 
	<p> Even though 1946 was also the same year when the NBA was founded, the NBA didn't have the name it has now until 1949 when the NBL and BAA merged together. </p> 
	
	<h2 id = "Forgotten and old stars"> Forgotten and old stars </h2> 
	<h2> George Mikan </h2> 
	<p> Often referred to as the first NBA star, George Mikan was the centerpiece of the early Minneapolis Lakers squads that were consistently great. </p> 
	<p> Mikan consistently average 24 points and 12 rebounds in his short but illustrious career and was the main reason for the Lakers winning 4 championships between 1947 and 1954. </p>

	<h2> Bob Petit </h2> 
	<p> Bob Petit was the first great power forward and the very first mvp. </p> 
	<p> Petit was the best rebounder of his time and averaged a exceptional 26 points and 16 rebounds in his 10 year career for the St.Louis Hawks. </p>
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Bob_Pettit_1961.jpeg/150px-Bob_Pettit_1961.jpeg" alt = "A picture of Bob Petit" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> John Havlicek </h2> 
	<p> John Havlicek was responsible for one of the greatest moments in NBA history ( Havlicek stole the ball ) and was the main guy for the Celtics in the late 60s and most of the 70s. </p> 
	<p> Havlicek was the guy responsible for taking over the reigns after Bob Cousy and then Bill Russell retired and helped the Celtics win 2 championships in the 70s. </p> 
	<p> He also averaged a great 22 points and 6.9 rebounds </p>

	<h2> Sam Jones </h2> 
	<p> Sam Jones was always a great 3rd or 4th guy during those early Celtics championship runs, he averaged a pretty good 18.9 points and 4 rebounds per game. </p> 
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Sam_Jones%2C_Boston_Celtics%2C_1969.jpg" alt = "A picture of Sam jones" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> Artis Gilmore </h2> 
	<p> Gilmore was the best Chicago Bulls player before Michael Jordan came around. </p> 
	<p> Even though the Bulls could never win, Gilmore was always excellent, averaging nearly 20 and 15 every season he was in Chicago. </p> 
	<img src = "https://www.legendsofbasketball.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AG.jpg" alt = "A picture of Artis Gilmore" height = "400" width - "400" class = "center" />
	<h2> Adrian Dantley </h2>
