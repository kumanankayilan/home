	<h1> THE NBA: Part 2 - The History. </h1> 
	<p> The NBA is 75 years old. Thats pretty young in terms of sports league ages. Even Basketball as a whole is a pretty young sport compared to many of its contemporaries. </p> 
	<p> For example: Hockey dates back thousands of years, Baseball is 200+ years old, American Football is over 150 years old and soccer is ancient. </p> 
	<p> To even further show how young Basketball is, the NHL was founded in 1917, the MLB was founded in 1876, the NFL was founded in 1920 and the first soccer world cup was in 1930. </p> 
	<p> Even though this sport and league is relatively young, it still has a LOT of history to go through. Heres what to expect: </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> The (shortened) history of each position </li>
	<li> Logo History </li>

	<h2 id = "The (shortened) history of each position"> The (shortened) history of each position </h2> 
	<p> Each position's role has morphed and mutated over the years to the point where now a power forward can play like a point guard and nobody bats an eye. </p> 
	<p> Still though, the roles were much more concrete back when the NBA was in its infant stages and thats what this section will talk about. </p> 
	<h3> The History of the Point Guard </h3> 
	<p> 1950s: The Point Guard position only had one true goal. That goal was to pass the ball. A great example of a super traditional point guard was Slater Martin the man that was the point guard for the Lakers. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/teams/legacy/www.nba.com/lakers/sites/lakers/files/media/news_121019_martin_650.jpg" alt "Slater Martin, the first true point guard" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> The Lakers star George Mikan was getting most of his point from Martin passing to him. This helped the lakers win a lot of championships in the 50s. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn-qa.nba.com/manage/2022/01/George-Mikan3A-scaled-e1643599936180.jpg" alt = "George Mikan, the first nba star" height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />
	<p> The 50s also saw the introduction of the first true legendary point guard: Bob Cousy. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn-qa.nba.com/manage/2021/12/Bob-Cousy-392x588.jpg" alt = "Bob cousy, the man that revoloutionized the Point Guard position today" height = "400" width =  "400" class = "center" />
	<p> Bob Cousy was touted as the first player to dazzle the NBA. He pioneered a lot of what many point guards do today like shooting from a distance, having handles and being flashy. </p> 
	<p> 1960s: With the arrival of Bill Russel to Cousy's Celtics the modern fastbreak was invented. </p> 
	<p> Cousy would grab the ball off a missed shot and bring it down the court to pass to Russell who scored with a dunk or a layup on the inside. </p> 
	<p> Cousy fully retired at the start of an era he kickstarted. </p> 
	<p> 1970s: The 70s saw yet another evolution of how the point guard played with the careers of two NBA greats: Lenny Wilkens and Walt Frazier. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2021/09/lenny-wilkens-driving-blazers.jpg" alt = "A picture of Lenny Wilkens a player who changed the point guard position for good." height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> While Wilkens was at the tail end of his career in the 70s, he was one of the first point guards to truly be the leader of a team and to have great defense. </p> 
	<p> He also brought a type of confidence that nobody had saw before. </li> 
	<p> Walt Frazier was also a player much like Wilkens. He led his Knicks to two titles in the 70s and was the textbook example of a leader on court. </p> 
	<p> 1980s: The 80s brought the biggest change yet. While Cousy was flashy nothing could compare to someone who was magical. </p> 
	<p> Magic Johnson is widely considered the greatest point guard of all time and its hard to see a reason to argue against that. </p> 
	<p> He brought a sense of style and flashiness that nobody in the NBA had ever seen before. He passed, scored, rebounded and pretty much did everything </p> 
	<p> Without Magic the point guard position would likely be stuck in its 70s roots. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.britannica.com/27/189527-050-5BAD12C2/Magic-Johnson.jpg" alt = "A picture of Magic Johnson, the man widely regarded to be the best point guard ever." height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />
	<p> 1990s and 2000s: These two decades didn't bring much revolution to the point guard position. Players like Gary Payton and Allen Iverson were good point guards but didn't do much to add to the position as a whole. </p> 
	<p> 2010s - now: Stephen Curry. He revoloutionized the point guard position a lot. Infact, he changed the NBA as a whole. </p> 
	<p> Stephen Curry single handedly made many players but especially the guard positions to shoot a lot of threes and to mainly run the offense. </p> 
	<p> Because of him guards like Luka Doncic and Trae Young are now thriving in the NBA. </p>

	<h3> The History of the Shooting Guard </h3> 
	<p> 1950s - 1980s : The shooting guard is a position that hasn't went through much changes. </p> 
	<p> Old shooting guards of the 50s and 60s like Bill Sharman, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson were the main offensive threat for the teams that they played for. </p> 
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Bill_Sharman%2C_Boston_Celtics%2C_signed.jpg/200px-Bill_Sharman%2C_Boston_Celtics%2C_signed.jpg" alt = "a picture of Bill Sharman the first star shooting guard" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<img src = "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79926e863416fc3895551b1633bab32ece507ee8/c=471-166-2475-2838/local/-/media/2017/02/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636221622778349810-c08-nbafeat-18.jpg" alt = "a picture of Oscar Roberston, the first triple double machine" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<img src = "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_4:3%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTY4MDMxMzY1ODQwMzgxMzEy/jerry-west-main-marqueejpg.jpg" alt = "A picture of Jerry West, the man who's on the logo of the NBA" height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />
	<p> They only really shot from mid range and close range and were known to get insane amounts of points. </p> 
	<p> In the 70s and 80s shooting guards like Pete Maravich and Clyde Drexler were more flashy and atheltic than their predecessors but not by a drastic amount </p> 
	<p> 1990s: Then Came Michael Jordan. Widely thought of as the greatest NBA player of all time, he dominated the 1990s and became an inspiration for shooting guards and other positions alike for many years to come. </p> 
	<p> Jordan was incredibly athletic, deadly on both sides of the court and was not a bad all around player as well. </p> 
	<p> He made it so that more players would be like him rather than the players of old. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/893.png" alt = "A picture of Michael Jordan" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> 2000s: One player to follow in his footsteps was Kobe Bryant. He played very similar to Jordan and furthered the idea to play like Jordan in the minds of many kids watching him. </p> 
	<img src = "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5e2e3af23f3d910008fc55c0/master/pass/remembering-kobe-bryant.jpg" alt = "A picture of Kobe Bryant" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> 2010s - now. With Stephen Curry doing what he did, many Shooting Guards nowadays rely on the three point line as their weapon of choice. </p> 
	<h3> The History of the Small Forward. </h3> 
	<p> The Small Forward has probably gone through the most drastic changes out of the 5 positions. </p> 
	<p> 1950s: In the early stages of the small forward, it was considered to be the worst and most useless position. THere was no real point to having the small forward there on the court. </p> 
	<p> In the 1960s and 1970s though, the likes of Elgin Baylor and Julius Erving brought the position to new heights. These forwards were bigger, stronger faster and were much better on defense. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/76681.png" alt = "A picture of Julius Erving" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> The 70s made it so that the small forward position was essentially a balance of the shooting guard and power forward position. </p> 
	<p> The 80s further built upon that with the likes of Larry bird and Adrian Dantely coming into the freigh. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/76504.png" alt = "a picture of Adrian Dantley" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> These players made the small forward notable for scoring and also being the primary defender on their team. </p> 
	<p> The 90s and 2000s saw many small forwards become incredibly strong on versatile with the likes of Rashard Lewis and Shawn Marion. </p> 
	<p> Finally the 2010s and 2020s saw Kevin Durant and Lebron James being the best players in the league while also showcasing how perfectly balanced this position is. </p> 
	<img src = "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/t_share/MTkwOTYwNTg2OTYyNTExNTE1/usatsi_17973502-1.jpg" alt = "A picture of Kevin Durant" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h3> The History of the Power Forward. </h3> 
	<p> The power forward is much like the shooting guard. They both have not gone through much changes but are weirdly inbetween the positions that went through the most. </p> 
	<p> In 50s and 60s power forwards ( and players as a whole ) were nowhere near today's players in terms of strenght, athletisicsm and skill. </p> 
	<p> Power forwards like Bob Petit were not the most physically gifted but were still good enough to make a name for themselves in the NBA. </p> 
	<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Bob_Pettit_1961.jpeg/150px-Bob_Pettit_1961.jpeg" alt = "A picture of Bob Petit" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> As the 70s and 80s came the power forward position became somewhat of a secondary center position. Players like Moses Malone and Connie Hawkins weren't tall enough for the center position so they just played the next best thing. </p> 
	<p> Larry Nance and Charles Oakley are also great examples of this. </p> 
	<p> The 90s and 2000s brought somewhat of a rennaisance for the power forward position though. </p> 
	<p> These decades saw the likes of Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki become legends of their sport and revoloutinize how the power forward is played. </p> 
	<img src = "https://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2019/0722/dm_160707_nba_tim_duncan_hof_legacy1042/dm_160707_nba_tim_duncan_hof_legacy1042.jpg" alt = " A picture of Tim Duncan" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> The 2010s furthered this notion as players like Pascal Siakam and Karl Anthony Towns became perfect representations of the power forwards of the decade before them. </p> 
	<p> These players made it so that the position wasn't really just the second center, but rather it was a position that was a blend of Small forward and the center position as a whole. </p> 
	<h3> The history of the Center. </h3> 
	<p> The Center position has gone through the weirdest changes throughout the course of the nba. </p> 
	<p> 1950 - 1990. The Center position didn't really go through much changes in the first 40 years of the NBA. </p> 
	<p> The players in this position were often the guy who played the most defense and rebounded the most. They were also often the biggest and strongest guy on the court. </p> 
	<p> The likes of George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russel, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Dave Cowens are all examples of how centers were for 40 years. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.britannica.com/65/234465-050-A5ECD52A/Bill-Russell-Boston-Celtics-undated-photo.jpg" alt = "A Photo of Bill Russell" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<p> Then the 90s came. The Center position became more dominant and mobile as a whole. Players like Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson were all much more athletic and dominant
    <img src = "https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/darrahbrustein/files/2019/01/Shaq-Headshot-1-1200x900.jpg?format=jpg&width=960" alt = "a picture of shaq" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />	
	than most of their predesscesors. </p> 
	<p> These players all won championships in the 90s and early 2000s. </p> 
	<p> The 2000s and early 2010s saw what was described to be the dark ages of the center. Not many centers were really comparable to the likes of the ones of the past and the center slowly became the 
	position with the least attraction. </p> 
	<p> The centers that were popular though like Dwight Howard and Ben Wallace were pretty similar to the likes of the 90s centers. </p> 
	<p> After Curry revoloutionized the NBA the center position was revitalized. </p> 
	<p> Players like Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid and Rudy Gobert showed that a center didn't have to be a one trick pony and rather they could be the most versatile position in the league. </p>

	<h3> Atlanta Hawks </h3>
    <p> The Hawks have gone through a decent bit of logo changes throughout their history. Their first logo was completely different from the rest of the Hawks logos to follow and even now the designs have become more minmalistic. </p> 
    <img src = "https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Atlanta-Hawks-Logo-history.jpg" alt = "A picture showing the history of each Atlanta Hawk logo" height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />	
	<h3> Boston Celtics </h3>

	<h3> Brooklyn Nets </h3>
	<p> Most of the Nets logos have followed the same few themes. Red, White and Blue colour scheme, and always to have a basketball in the logo. Their most recent logo though signalled a rebrand for the team. </p>

	<h3> Cleveland Caveliers </h3> 
	<p> The Cavs have always had pretty drastic logo changes but they almost always focused at least a little on the sword aspect of the Cavaliers name. </p> 
	<img src = "https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CAVS-Logo-history.png" alt = "A picture showing the logo history of the Cleveland Cavaliers" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<h3> Dallas Mavericks </h3>

	<h3> Detroit Pistons </h3> 
	<p> The pistons have had an interesting logo history. For a few years the logo was a tin man and for a few it was a horse, but most of the time its the basic circle with the name of the team with varying colours. </p> 
	<img src = "https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Detroit-Pistons-Logo-history.jpg" alt = "A picture showing the Detroit Pistons logo history" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
