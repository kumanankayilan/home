	<h1> THE NBA: Part 3 - The Best. </h1> 
	<p> The NBA has had quite a few greats come and go throughout the years. Some may argue some are better than others, the lists shown here are just a matter of opinion </p> 
	<p> These lists are the right lists they are just the lists that I've made. Here is what to expect: </p>

	<h2 id = "The best teams ever." > The best teams ever. </h2> 
	<p> This list is who I think are the 5 best teams ever. I judged based off of record and their accomplishments that season </h2> 
	<ol> 
	<li> 1995 - 96  Chicago Bulls </li> 
	<p> This is the greatest NBA team ever. The bulls had just come off of a second round exit at the hands of the Magic in the prior season but they were 
	ready to contend again. With the return of Michael Jordan in his full form the newly establish big 3 of Jordan, Pippen and Rodman began to dominate. </p>
	<p> They set a record 72 wins and 10 losses a record that stood for 20 years. The dominated their way through the playoffs culminating with a finals win against the SuperSonics. </p> 
	<img src = "https://www.grunge.com/img/gallery/what-the-1995-96-chicago-bulls-look-like-now/intro-1539292273.jpg" alt = "A picture of Jordan, Pippen and Rodman looking at each other" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 2015 - 2016 Golden State Warriors </li> 
	<p> This team probably would have been the greatest ever NBA team if they just won the title that year. The warriors had everything going for them, they had just come off their first title in 40 years
	their team had only gotten better, and Steph Curry was gearing up to repeat as MVP. </p> 
	<p> The team romped through the regular season winning a grand total of 73 games which just barely beat the previous record set by the Bulls in 96. They destroyed their way to the finals
	where they blew a 3 - 1 lead over the Cleveland Caveliers and Lebron James. </p>
	<img src = "https://pm1.narvii.com/6477/8f63133342eb519db9b368013882cf7d95836126_hq.jpg" alt = "Curry, Klay, Draymond and many more players celebrating" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 1985 - 1986 Boston Celtics </li> 
	<p> Even though there were a lot of Celtics teams that could be in this spot, the 85 - 86 team was someting special. This was at the height of Larry Bird's already storied career and his 
	co - stars Kevin Mchale and Robert Parsish were also playing at a top level. </p> 
	<p> They were absolutely dominant at home and held a 67 - 15 record. They made their way through the playoffs with relative ease and won the championship that season pretty handedly. </p> 
	<p> Larry Bird won his 3 straight and final MVP to perfectly cap this season off for the Celtics </p>
	<img src = "http://pm1.narvii.com/6414/ddb646a54d9b8c02c709c20dee17d01f0236ca91_00.jpg" alt = "A picture of the Celtics starting 5." height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 1996 - 97 Chicago Bulls </li> 
	<p> After a legendary season prior, the Bulls had a lot of pressure to repeat as champions and to repeat their regular season success. </p> 
	<p> The Bulls did just that as they ended up with a 69 - 13 record and won the championship in 6 games against the Utah Jazz. Jordan played an MVP worthy season, and Pippen and Rodman both were just as important as they were last year. </p> 
	<img src = "https://history.bulls.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1997-05-20-Gm-1-v-MIA-ECF-Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Dennis-Rodman-NBAE-Andrew-Bernstein-1200x800.jpg" alt = "A picture of the bulls big 3" height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 1970 - 71 Milwaukee Bucks </li> 
	<p> The Bucks were genuine title contenders for the first time in their history as Kareem Abdul Jabbar was in his prime and Oscar Robertson was just exiting it. </p> 
	<p> The Bucks won 66 games and dominated throughout the playoffs. Kareem won MVP and the Bucks won their first title in NBA history. </p>
	<img src = "https://i1.wp.com/throwbacksportsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AP7101010648-Bucks-71-BP.jpg?fit=644%2C424&ssl=1" Alt "A picture of the bucks starting 5" height = "400" width "400" class = "center" />
	</ol> 
	
	<h2 id = "The best seasons ever." > The best seasons ever. </h2> 
	<p> This list is what I think are the 5 best seasons ever. I judged based off of what happened during the season and how they are looked back upon. </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> 2015 - 2016 </li> 
	<p> The 2015 - 2016 season was one for the ages. </p> 
	<p> This season saw many moments for the ages happen that will be detailed further in part 4. </p> 
	<p> The legendary run by the Warriors, the block, The retirement of Kobe, Curry and his legendary run, the raptors breaking new ground were all just a few moments that defined this legendary season </p> 
	<p> There were many clutch moments as a whole too, Kyrie's deep 3, Curry from deep against okc and the aformentioned block are all decade and season defining clutch moments. </p>
	<img src = "https://kingjamesgospel.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/07/541552066.jpeg" alt = "A picture of the 2015 - 2016 cavs" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 2021 - 2022 </li> 
	<p> The 2021 - 2022 season was another very great season. </p> 
	<p> History was made time after time this season as Stephen Curry became the 3 point champion, Gregg Popovich became the most winningest coach ever, and Marcus Smart became the first guard to win dpoty after 20 + years. </p> 
	<p> The season also had the taking over of the new guard. Ja Morant, Scottie Barnes, and Devin Booker are all players that are now being entrusted with the keys to the league. </p> 
	<p> Finally the emphasis on the number 75. The most recent season was the 75th season and everything was centered on that very thing. The 75th anniversary team, the diamond ball even the promotional arts were all styled around the 75th anniversary </p>

	<li> 2018 - 2019 </li> 
	<p> The 2018 - 2019 season was a very important season for the NBA. </p> 
	<p> This season saw the dismantlement of the Warriors at the hands of Kawhi Leonard and saw some of the greatest playoffs the NBA has seen in a while. </p> 
	<p> Many clutch moments like Lillard waving goodbye to OKC to 4 bounces from Kawhi were defining moments of this season </p>

	<p> The Season saw the rise of giannis and the introduction of Luka and Trae as well. </p> 
	<li> 2011 - 2012 </li>
	<p> The 2011 - 2012 season, was yet another season last decade that was legendary. This season saw the rise of Derrick rose, The Miami Heat and Kevin Durant to say a few. </p> 
	<p> Many teams were competitive such as the lakers, mavericks, celtics and the heat and the sheer dominance of Lebron James was enough to put this season on this list for me. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2018/10/derrick-rose-mvp-2011.jpg" alt = "Derrick Rose winning the MVP award" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> 1995 - 1996 </li> 
	<p> This season was absolutely legendary for one main thing: Michael Jordan. This was the first full season back for Jordan and he and the bulls won a then record 72 games. </p> 
	<p> The season also saw the rise of the SuperSonics, the first season for the Raptors and Grizzlies and many rivalries come to fruition such as the Bulls vs basically everybody and the Heat vs knicks </p>

	</ol>
	
	<h2 id = "The best coaches ever."> The best coaches ever. </h2> 
	<p> This list is who I think are the best 5 coaches ever. I judged based off of accolades and achievements. </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Gregg Popovich </li> 
	<p> Gregg Popovich is the greatest coach of all time. No debate. He has the most wins out of any coach in NBA history and was the man behind the spurs 20 year dynasty. </p> 
	<p> He is the reason the San Antonio Spurs were so consistent for so long. He is also the person that managed to keep a constantly changing team to defeat the likes of the Lakers, Cavaliers, and the Heat </p> 
    <p> Popovich was also an olympic head coach multiple times too. </p> 
	<img src = "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKq.WwqakWoQ/v2/1200x-1.jpg" alt = "A picture of Gregg Popovich" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> Phil Jackson </li> 
	<p> Phil Jackson is a legend. He is the only coach to three peat with two different teams and the only coach to win more than 3 titles with multiple teams as well. </p> 
	<p> He is the man behind the 6 Chicago Bulls championships and the 5 Lakers championships of this century. </p> 
	<p> Not only is he an amazing coach he managed to mitigate the egos of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal well enough to win multiple championships with each of them </p> 
	<img src = "https://i.insider.com/5040ca5769bedd0e05000047?width=1000&format=jpeg&auto=webp" alt = "A picture of Phil Jackson" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> Red Auerbach </li> 
	<p> Red was the coach behind the first dynasty. He is the man that was behind most of the Celtics run of 11 championships and was the man that helped Bill Russell and Bob Cousy become the players that they are known for today. </p>
	<img src = "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTY4MTkyMjk3OTk2MzMwOTA5/red_auerbach_sijpg.jpg" alt = "Red Auerbach smoking a cigar" height = "400" width = "400" class "center" />
	<li> Larry Brown </li> 
	<p> Larry Brown coached quite a lot of teams and brought each of them to legendary heights. </p> 
	<p> Even though he only won a single championship with the Pistons, he brought teams like the 76ers to the finals and the Pacers to competitive heights. </p> 
	<img src = "https://cdn.britannica.com/42/192842-050-69AF0BCC/Larry-Brown-2000.jpg" alt = "A picture of Larry Brown" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" />
	<li> Steve Kerr </li> 
	<p> This coach is still writing his history. He is the man behind the dominance that was the Warriors last decade and part of this decade. </p> 
	<p> His coaching style brought about a new era of fast paced but balanced play styles in the NBA </p>

	<p> These are what I think are the best records ever. </p>
	<ol> 
	<li> Most points in a game </li> 
	<p> The most points ever scored in a game was a 100 by Wilt Chamberlain. He dropped a 100 points on the Knicks in March of 1962. </p> 
	<p> Wilt Chamberlain set a record that still hasn't been beat to this day. The picture of him holding up the 100 point sign is one of the most well known basketball pictures ever. </p>

	<li> Most points ever </li> 
	<p> Kareem Abdul Jabbar set the record for most points ever scored in a career with 38,387 </p> 
	<p> He has scored more points than Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant and Lebron James ( though not for much longer ) and his iconic record has withstood the test of time for nearly 35 years. </p> 
	<img src = "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar.jpg" alt = "A picture of Kareem becoming the first player to hit 34,000 points" height = "400" width = "400" class = "center" 
	<li> Most blocks in a game </li> 
	<p> The most blocks in a game ever recorded was 17 blocks by Elmore Smith of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1973. </p> 
	<p> Getting more than 3 blocks is already an impressive feat so to literally multiply that by 5 and a little more is insane. </p> 
	<p> How does a relatively unknown player in Elmore Smith get to the point where 17 shots are completely swatted? </p> 
	<p> Why would anyone even take a shot if they are being guarded by him that game? </p>

	<li> Most wins in a season </li> 
	<p> The most wins in a season is 73 by the Golden State Warriors in 2015 - 2016. </p> 
	<p> The Warriors were nothing but dominant in the regular season of 2015 - 2016. </p> 
	<p> They remain the only team ever to lose a single digit amount of games. </p> 
	<p> This team was so dangerous that people genuinely thought that this was the second coming of the 50s and 60s Celtics </p> 
	<p> Thankfully it was not that. </p>

	<li> Most triple doubles ever </li> 
	<p> A triple double is when 3 out of 5 stats (points, assists,rebounds,steals, and blocks) get to double digits </p> 
	<p> Russell Westbrook holds the records for most triple doubles ever with 194. </p> 
	<p> How can a player be so versatile to the point where he records double digit stats in multiple sections 194 times? </p> 
	<p> Some of the greatest players ever like Kawhi leonard haven't even cracked 5. </p>

	<h2 id = "The best rivalries ever."> The best rivalries ever. </h2> 
	<p> These are what I think are the greatest rivalries ever. </p> 
	<ol> 
	<li> Boston Celtic vs Los Angeles Lakers </li> 
	<p> The Boston Celtics vs the Los Angeles Lakers rivalry is storied and documented so many times that every casual NBA fan at least knows a little about it. </p> 
	<p> In the early days of the NBA the teams that constantly battled it out for a championship were the Bill Russell and Bob Cousy Celtics and the Jerry West and Elgin Baylor Lakers </p> 
	<p> At the time the rivalry was pretty lopsided with the Celtics consistenly winning almost each and every time they faced up. </p> 
	<p> The rivalry became more even in the 70s and 80s with the Celtics and Lakers trading blows back and forth. The rivalry became especially popular in the 80s with the player rivalry of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. </p> 
	<p> This decade saw the Celtics winning 3 championships and the Lakers winning 5. </p> 
	<p> The rivalries most recent spark up was in the 2000s when the Celtics and Lakers met up twice in 3 years </p> 
	<p> Both of the series were went more than the default amount of games and the 2nd series especially is touted as one of the best finals ever. </p> 
	<p> The Lakers and Celtics have both won 17 championships with the most recent being the Lakers in 2020. </p>  
	<li> New York Knicks vs Miami Heat </li> 
	<p> The Knicks vs Heat rivalry was a rivalry that was only really popular in the 90s. </p> 
	<p> The Knicks had a coach by the name of Pat Riley. Riley brought the knicks to the highest heights they had ever been too since the 70s and then up and left. </p> 
	<p> The team he left for was the Miami Heat. </p> 
	<p> Because of this, the meetups between these teams were always heated especially for the fans. </p> 
	<p> The rivalry became more heated when former teammates Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning joined each the teams. These teams met 4 times from 97 to 2000. A bench clearing brawl even happened. </p> 
	<li> Chicago Bulls vs Detroit Pistons </li> 
	<p> The Bulls vs Pistons rivalry was short but nasty. These teams had it out for each other in the late 80s and early 90s. </p> 
	<p> The Pistons initially had the upper hand with their foul now score later attitude that got them the nickname "The Bad Boys" </p> 
	<p> Their rough and tumble play was especially hated by the Celtics Larry Bird and pretty much everyone on the Chicago Bulls </p> 
	<p> The Bulls and Pistons nearly got into a fight countless amounts of times and since they were in the same conference they met up quite a few times. </p> 
	<p> Most times in the playoffs these series became even more heated.</p> 
	<p> By the 90s though, the Bulls began to take over and caused the infamous moment when the Pistons walked out of the game before the timer even ran out. </p> 
	<li> Sacremento Kings vs winning </li>
	<p> The Kings have not made a single playoff appearance since before I was born. </p> 
	<p> This team has squandered nearly every single ability to win such as passing up upon players like Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry or trading young stars like Tyrese Haliburton 
	or Demarcus Cousins. </p> 
	<p> The kings haven't even won a title since they became the kings. Their first and only title was in 1956 as the Rochester Royals and was lead by Oscar Robertson.</p> 
	<p> Thankfully the Kings seem to be looking up, as they finally drafted correctly and have built a team that seems that it could at least contend for a play - in spot. </p>
	<li> Shaquille O'Neal vs Howard </li> 
	<p> This is likely the funniest out of all the rivalries on this list. </p> 
	<p> Both players had pretty similar careers at a certain point. </p> 
	<p> Both players first two teams were the same and so were their coaches. </p> 
	<p> They also both had problems with Kobe but after that their careers took different paths </p> 
	<p> Dwight showed up to a dunk contest during all star weekend as Superman. </p> 
	<p> Shaq took offense to this as that was his nickname and threw some shade </p> 
	<p> The constant jabs and mockery became fluctuated over the years as Shaq retired and became an analyst and Dwight journied into his twilight years. </p>
